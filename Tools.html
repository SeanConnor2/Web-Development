        <h1>Ethical/Non-Ethical Hackers</h1>
        <p>
          Ethical and Non-Ethical Hackers use many different tools to find vulnerabilities in a system.  Above shows three different tools that hackers use.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first tool is a common flash drive.  This can be loaded with various types of scripts--keyloggers, Trojans, File Infectors, Network Virus'--the list goes on and on.  Once the flash drive is inserted into a computer, the script can be loaded and executed quickly and find its spot on the computer/network.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next tool is an operating system called Kali Linux.  It is an open source operating system used by many penetration testers to break into systems.  A lot of hackers found that they can use various different types of operating systems to find vulnerabilities.  Some operating systems work better than others in certain situations.

        <p>
          The third tool is a wifi pinapple.  This is used to find holes in a network.  It can also be used to spoof a wifi hotspot.  This can be extreamly effective because a lot of phones will auto connect to a public wifi that they are in range of.  This allows the hacker access to the mobile device that has connected to the wifi. The pinapple can also be used for man in the middle attacks, covering the tracks of the hacker.

        <p>
          There are a number of different tools online that can be used by  hackers to find vulnerabilities within a system or a network.  There is also an endless amount of scripts for hackers to use and manipulate to their likeing online.
