             <h1>What Is Cybersecurity?</h1>
             <p>
               Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems, including hardware, software and data, from cyberattacks.
             </p>
            <h1>Types Of Cybersecurity Threats</h1>
            <p>
              The process of keeping up with new technologies, security trends and threat intelligence is a challenging task. However, it's necessary in order to protect information and other assets from cyberthreats, which take many forms.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ransomware is a type of malware that involves an attacker locking the victim's computer system files -- typically through encryption -- and demanding a payment to decrypt and unlock them.
              </li>
              <li>Malware is any file or program used to harm a computer user, such as worms, computer viruses, Trojan horses and spyware.
              </li>
              <li>Social engineering is an attack that relies on human interaction to trick users into breaking security procedures in order to gain sensitive information that is typically protected.
              </li>
              <li>Phishing is a form of fraud where fraudulent emails are sent that resemble emails from reputable sources; however, the intention of these emails is to steal sensitive data, such as credit card or login information.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h1>What Cybersecurity Can Prevent</h1>
            <p>
              The use of cybersecurity can help prevent cyberattacks, data breaches and identity theft and can aid in risk management.
            </p>
            <p>
              When an organization has a strong sense of network security and an effective incident response plan, it is better able to prevent and mitigate these attacks. For example, end user protection defends information and guards against loss or theft while also scanning computers for malicious code.
            </p>
